# Eire Settlers
(Developer: Valentino Braga)

Eire Settlers is a dynamic full-stack Django project designed to cultivate a vibrant community for immigrants relocating to Ireland. This project's purpose is to empower newcomers with essential information and establish a supportive network. Serving as a comprehensive platform, Eire Settlers enables individuals to share insights, experiences, and valuable advice on various aspects of settling in Ireland. Inspired by the active engagement of the Brazilian community on Facebook groups, Eire Settlers has evolved into a dedicated platform aimed at enhancing this concept. Drawing from the collaborative spirit observed within online communities, the goal is to provide a structured and inclusive space where immigrants from all backgrounds can come together to exchange knowledge, seek guidance, and forge meaningful connections as they embark on their journey to Ireland.

## User Stories

For the project's advancement, I generated 29 user stories that detailed the essential tasks for achieving a well-constructed website. Following an agile development approach, I then categorized these user stories into 5 distinct Epics on the Kanban board to manage the project's progression effectively.

## Design
The project's design was inspired and created to envelop users in a friendly and inviting atmosphere, carefully selecting pastel hues to evoke warmth and approachability. Drawing from color psychology principles, soft tones like green, beige, blue, and turquoise were chosen for their calming and uplifting effects, ensuring a positive user experience. To convey credibility and refinement, the Protest Strike and Titillium fonts were meticulously selected, striking a balance between elegance and seriousness. This thoughtful combination instills confidence and reliability in users, fostering trust and engagement from the moment they land on the website.

### Typography
Introducing a refined and trustworthy aesthetic, I chose the Protest Strike and Titillium fonts to convey elegance and credibility. Titillium exudes a subtle sophistication with its clean lines and balanced proportions, while Protest Strike adds a touch of gravitas with its sturdy and authoritative appearance. This carefully curated combination strikes a harmonious balance between elegance and seriousness, instilling confidence and reliability in the users.

### Colour Scheme
The website colour scheme adopts a friendly and pastel color scheme, strategically chosen to evoke a sense of warmth and approachability. Drawing from the principles of color psychology, our palette incorporates soft hues such as green, bege, blue, and turquoise. These pastel tones are known for their calming and uplifting effects, creating a visually pleasing environment that promotes a positive user experience.

### Imagery
In imagery, I've chosed a captivating centerpiece to resonate with the website's mission of fostering community among immigrants. The main illustration, sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), portrays a diverse array of individuals connecting and interacting harmoniously. Through vibrant depictions of shared experiences and cultural diversity, this illustration beautifully encapsulates the essence of the platform's goalâ€”to unite immigrants and create a supportive, inclusive community.

### Future Features
A few features that could make the website even better are listed here. These features have been logged as "Future Release" in my [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/tinobragaa/projects/3/views/1).

- **Dark Mode**
  - Introducing a dark mode option can enhance user experience by reducing eye strain and making the website more visually appealing in low-light environments. Users can switch between light and dark modes based on their preference.

- **Social Media Login**
  - Enabling social media login functionality allows users to sign in to the platform using their existing social media accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google. This feature simplifies the registration and login process, saving users time and effort. Additionally, it enhances user convenience by eliminating the need to remember separate login credentials for the platform.

- **Add Friend Functionality**
  - Incorporating an "Add Friend" feature enables users to expand their social connections within the website's community. Users can send friend requests to others, fostering interaction and engagement. This feature enhances the social aspect of the platform and encourages networking among users.

- **Search Functionality**
  - Integrating a robust search functionality enhances user navigation and accessibility. Users can quickly locate specific content, such as articles, posts, or user profiles, by entering relevant keywords or filters. This feature improves user satisfaction by facilitating effortless content discovery and retrieval.

- **Tag Functionality**
  - Implementing a tag system allows users to categorize and organize content effectively. Users can assign tags to their posts, articles, or other contributions, enabling easy classification based on topics, themes, or interests. This feature enhances content organization, promotes discoverability, and facilitates targeted content consumption for users.

## Database Design
I utilized [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to create an entity relationship diagram, offering a clear visualization of the interconnections among my data structures. This streamlined the development process by offering a comprehensive visualization.

## Agile Development

### GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects was utilized as an Agile tool for managing this project. This platform facilitated the planning and tracking of user stories, issues, and epics, which were then monitored on a weekly basis using a basic Kanban board setup.

- User Stories: full list [here](https://github.com/tinobragaa/eire-settlers/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-asc+).
- Epics: full list [here](https://github.com/tinobragaa/eire-settlers/milestones).

![Kanban Board](/docs/kanban-board.jpg)

### GitHub Issues
GitHub Issues functioned as an additional Agile tool for me. I employed my custom User Story Template within it to organize user stories effectively. Additionally, it facilitated tracking milestones (Epics) for the project.

### MoSCoW Prioritization
I broke down my Epics into individual stories before prioritizing and implementing them. This method allowed me to utilize the MoSCoW prioritization and apply labels to the user stories in the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Deploy with Heroku
This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host and deploy the website

To deploy your website using Heroku, begin by signing up for a Heroku account. Then, proceed with the following steps:s
1. Go on to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website and [log in](https://id.heroku.com/login) if you already have an account or [sign up](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you don't. 
2. Click on the "New" button on the top right of the home page and select "Create new App" from the drop-down menu.
3. In the "App name" field enter the name of your app. This name has to be unique. 
    - Heroku displays a green tick if your app name is available.
4. In the "Choose a region" field choose either the United States or Europe based on your location.
5. Click the "Create app" button.
6. Next page, top centre of the screen, select the "Settings" tab. 
7. In the "Config Vars" section, click on the "Reveal config Vars" button.
8. In this section you need to enter your environment variables. Usually stored in the env.py file locally. In my case, I have the folllwing variables: 
    - SECRET_KEY - Django secret key.
    - CLOUDINARY_URL - Cloudinary API key.
    - DATABASE_URL - ElephantSQL database URL.
9. Copy and paste these variables into the KEY field and their values into the VALUE field.
10. Go back to the top of the screen and select the "Deploy" tab.
11. In the "Deployment method" section select "GitHub".
    1. In "Connect to GitHub" click on the "Search" button. Find the project repository in the list and click on the "Connect" button.
    2. Scroll to the bottom of that page. Click on the "Deploy Branch" button to deploy.
    3. You should also see an option to enable automatic deployment. If you enable this, every time you push to GitHub, Heroku will automatically deploy the app.
12. You will see build log scrolling at the bottom of the screen after that. When successfully finished building the app, you should see the link to your app.
