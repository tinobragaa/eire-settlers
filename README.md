# Deployment

[Click Here To See The Live Website]()

### Deploy
The website was deployed through the use of GitHub Pages, a feature built in to GitHub. This can be done by following the steps below.
1. In the desired repository, click on "Settings" from the top menu.
2. From the side menu to your left, select "Pages" in the "Code and automation" section.
3. Make sure the "Source" option is set to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the desired "Branch" from the drop down below (main branch in most cases, making sure the director is set to /(root)).
5. Select "Save", and after it refreshes the page, you will see a box at the top of the page providing you with the URL of your now published site.

To contribute or check the code yourself, you can fork or clone the repository as well.

### Fork
1. Go to the desired repository
2. Click "Fork" in the upper right corner
3. Select the owner, and set the repository name. A description can be added if desired
4. Choose whether to copy the default branch, or all branches
5. Click "Create Form"

### Clone

1. Go to the desired repository
2. Click the "Code" button at the top of the files section of the page
3. Select your desired method for cloning (HTTPS/SSH/GitHub CLI)
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory
6. Type "git clone", and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of "YOUR-USERNAME": "$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DESIRED-REPOSITORY"
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

### Heroku

1. Create a user account with Heroku.
2. Click New in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard.
3. Click on the dropdown menu and select create new.
4. The app name is unique to all apps within Heroku so select one that is not currently in use.
5. Select a region, EU or USA.
6. Click Create App.
7. In the app settings click Reveal Config vars, set the value of KEY to PORT, and the value to 8000 and click add.
8. Click Add Buildpack.
9. Choose Python first and click add.
10. Choose Node.js second.
11. The order is important, Python needs to be first, then Node.js second.
12. Click on the Deploy tab, select connect to Github and search for your repository.
13. Click on Enable automatic deploy or Deploy branch depending on your use case.
